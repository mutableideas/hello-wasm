# Hello Wasm
The purpose of the repo is to determine the better Developer Exerpience from four different options for developing a Hello World App with Web Assembly.

The `hello-worlds` presented here will be part of an application and not full application.  We'll reference the output in the `wasm-hello` project `nest` application.

## AssemblyScript

## Blazor

## Go

## Rust

## wasm-hello
This is a `NestJs` application to test out the `hello-world` applications.  See [Nest ReadMe.md](./wasm-hello/README.md) for details to get it up and running.
